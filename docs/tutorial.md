# litmap Tutorial

This tutorial walks through the main workflows: searching your Zotero library semantically, generating paper maps, clustering a collection, and using litmap alongside a manuscript in progress.

---

## 1. Setup

Install and add a shell alias so you can run `litmap` from any directory:

```bash
cd ~/src/Cowork/litmap
uv venv
uv pip install -e .

# Add a global alias (do this once)
echo 'alias litmap="uv run --project ~/src/Cowork/litmap litmap"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Without the alias, `litmap` only works when your working directory is inside `~/src/Cowork/litmap/`. With the alias, `litmap` works from anywhere.

Then run the initial sync:

```bash
litmap sync
```

You will see a progress bar while `Alibaba-NLP/gte-modernbert-base` (~570 MB) downloads and your Zotero library is embedded. On Apple Silicon, embeddings run on the Metal GPU (MPS) automatically.

```
Syncing new papers: 100%|████████████████| 347/347 [01:23<00:00,  4.1 paper/s]
Embedded 347 new papers.
```

**Initial sync time:** The first sync embeds your entire Zotero library using title and abstract and only needs to run once. On a MacBook Air M4, embedding ~31,000 papers took approximately 6.5 hours. The Air throttles the CPU and GPU to manage heat, so throughput drops significantly after the first ~10,000 papers (from >100 papers/s down to ~10 papers/s). Incremental syncs are fast because they only process items not already in the cache.

---

## 2. Full-text Embedding

Title and abstract embeddings are quick to compute but capture limited semantic detail. For better search, map, and cluster quality, embed the full PDF text:

```bash
litmap sync-fulltext
```

This reads each paper's local PDF, extracts the text, and stores it as a series of overlapping 512-token chunks. `search` then scores a paper by its single best-matching chunk, so a relevant section is found even in a long paper that is mostly about something else. Papers with no local PDF keep using their title+abstract vector.

A full-library run takes hours. Throughput depends on your machine, chunk size and PDF lengths — measure it on your own library rather than trusting a number here. The run is safe to interrupt: each paper is committed as it finishes, and re-running skips what is already done.

At the end, any PDFs that could not be read are listed by Zotero key. Scanned PDFs with no text layer are the usual cause; the paper simply keeps its title+abstract vector.

### Recommended workflow

Try the default on one collection, confirm the results look right, then run the library:

```bash
# Step 1: one collection, default chunk size
litmap sync-fulltext --collection Credible_Bib

# Step 2: the whole library (safe to interrupt and resume)
litmap sync-fulltext
```

`--force` with `--collection` re-embeds only papers in that collection — the rest of the library is untouched. Use it when trying a different `--chunk-tokens` on a small set.

### Checking a paper's embedding status

```bash
litmap info "Chung 2026"
litmap info 10.1038/s41586-024-12345-6
litmap info ABC12DEF
```

Output:

```
Title:      Credible biodiversity metrics for high-integrity nature markets
Authors:    Chung et al.
Year:       2026
DOI:        10.1111/...
Zotero key: ABC12DEF
PDF:        /Users/you/Zotero/storage/ABC12DEF/Chung2026.pdf

Title+abstract embedded: yes, 2026-05-01
Full-text embedded:      yes, 2026-05-10 (3201 tokens, 2 chunks)
```

## 3. Searching Your Library

### Find papers similar to a sentence

```bash
litmap search --query "deep learning models for species distribution modelling"
```

Output:
```
 1. [0.921] Machine learning in species distribution modelling
     Valavi, Roozbeh, Elith, Jane 2022  10.1111/geb.13476
 2. [0.908] A comparison of machine learning methods for modelling ...
     Norberg, Anna 2019  10.1111/ecog.04547
```

Scores range 0–1. Anything above ~0.85 is a strong semantic match.

### Scope to a collection

```bash
litmap search \
  --query "carbon sequestration tropical forests" \
  --collection "Chapter 2 refs" \
  --top-k 5
```

### Search from a focal paper

Find what else in your library is similar to a paper you already know:

```bash
litmap search --paper "10.1126/science.1256014"
# or by title fragment:
litmap search --paper "Sensing biodiversity"
```

The focal paper is excluded from its own results. If the title isn't an exact match, litmap suggests close alternatives.

### Machine-readable output

```bash
litmap search \
  --query "functional diversity trait-based ecology" \
  --format json | jq '.results[].title'
```

---

## 4. Mapping a Zotero Collection

```bash
litmap map \
  --collection "My Papers" \
  --output ~/Desktop/litmap_collection
```

This writes three files:

| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `litmap_collection.html` | Interactive browser map — hover for title/author/year, pan and zoom |
| `litmap_collection.png` | 300 DPI raster for presentations or supplementary material |
| `litmap_collection.pdf` | Vector format for journal submission |

Open the HTML file in any browser. Each node is a paper; edges connect the k nearest semantic neighbours. Colour runs along the x-axis (viridis palette) — papers at opposite ends of the colour scale are semantically distant. Cluster labels (TF-IDF keywords from title and abstract) appear in dark teal boxes.

### Adjusting layout density

`--n-neighbors` controls UMAP's neighbourhood size. Lower values (e.g. 3, the default) produce tighter, more separated clusters by emphasising local structure. Higher values (e.g. 30–50) produce smoother, more globally coherent layouts.

```bash
# Default: tight local clusters
litmap map --collection "My Papers" --output ~/Desktop/tight

# Broader, more global layout
litmap map --collection "My Papers" --n-neighbors 30 --output ~/Desktop/broad

# Fewer graph edges
litmap map --collection "My Papers" --edge-k 2 --output ~/Desktop/sparse
```

---

## 5. Mapping a Manuscript's Bibliography

If you have a PDF, DOCX, `.bib`, or `.tex` file, litmap extracts its references and maps only the papers it can match in your Zotero library.

```bash
litmap map \
  --manuscript ~/Documents/my_paper.pdf \
  --output ~/Desktop/litmap_bib
```

This is useful for checking the semantic coverage of your citations — do they cluster around one topic, or spread across the field?

---

## 6. Manuscript + Collection Maps

The most informative workflow: position your manuscript *within* its citation landscape.

### Mode A — Collection only, manuscript shown as a node

Your manuscript appears as a red star at its semantic position among the collection papers. You can see which "neighbourhood" of the literature your paper falls in.

```bash
litmap map \
  --collection "My Papers" \
  --manuscript ~/Documents/my_paper.pdf \
  --output ~/Desktop/litmap_positioned
```

Use `--center-manuscript` to bias the manuscript node toward the centre of the layout. UMAP still optimises its final position based on actual embedding distances, so the result is semantically honest — the init position just biases it centrally when the data permits:

```bash
litmap map \
  --collection "My Papers" \
  --manuscript ~/Documents/my_paper.pdf \
  --center-manuscript \
  --output ~/Desktop/litmap_centered
```

### Mode B — Bibliography only

Map just the papers you cited, with your manuscript as an additional node.

```bash
litmap map \
  --manuscript ~/Documents/my_paper.pdf \
  --output ~/Desktop/litmap_bib_only
```

### Mode C — Union (collection + bibliography)

Include every paper in the collection *plus* any additional papers from your bibliography not already in the collection.

```bash
litmap map \
  --collection "My Papers" \
  --manuscript ~/Documents/my_paper.pdf \
  --union \
  --output ~/Desktop/litmap_union
```

---

## 7. Clustering a Paper Set

`litmap cluster` groups papers into a labelled semantic hierarchy (up to two levels) and produces both a **dendrogram** (for visual inspection) and an **outline** (for reading).

### Cluster a collection

```bash
litmap cluster \
  --collection "My Papers" \
  --output ~/Desktop/litmap_clusters
```

This writes six files:

| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `litmap_clusters.html` | Interactive dendrogram — hover on a leaf to see title and Zotero key |
| `litmap_clusters.png` / `.pdf` | Static dendrogram, 300 DPI |
| `litmap_clusters.md` | Human-readable outline: each cluster labelled by TF-IDF keywords, members listed as short references |
| `litmap_clusters.json` | Machine-readable outline (same structure), ready for scripting |
| `litmap_clusters.linkage.npy` | scipy linkage cache — skip re-clustering in downstream analyses |

The Markdown outline looks like this:

```markdown
# litmap cluster — My Papers (74 papers)

## 1. species · distribution · modelling  (28 papers)
- Valavi et al. 2022 — *Predictive performance of presence-only SDMs*
- Norberg 2019 — *A comprehensive evaluation of predictive performance of 33 SDMs*
  [in: Chapter 2]
...
```

### Cluster a manuscript's bibliography

```bash
litmap cluster \
  --manuscript ~/Documents/my_paper.pdf \
  --output ~/Desktop/bib_clusters
```

Useful for building a discussion section outline: the clusters reveal the thematic groupings implicit in what you cited.

### Cluster both a collection and a bibliography

```bash
litmap cluster \
  --collection "My Papers" \
  --manuscript ~/Documents/my_paper.pdf \
  --union \
  --output ~/Desktop/union_clusters
```

`--union` is required when both `--collection` and `--manuscript` are provided.

### Tuning the hierarchy

```bash
# Force exactly 5 top-level clusters
litmap cluster --collection "My Papers" --top-clusters 5 --output ~/Desktop/c5

# Split any cluster with 10+ papers into sub-clusters (default threshold: 20)
litmap cluster --collection "My Papers" --subcluster-threshold 10 --output ~/Desktop/deep
```

`--top-clusters` defaults to `max(2, round(sqrt(N/2)))` — about 6 clusters for a 72-paper collection, 12 for a 288-paper collection.

### Cluster the entire library

If you omit both `--collection` and `--manuscript`, litmap clusters every item in your Zotero library:

```bash
litmap cluster --output ~/Desktop/full_library_clusters
```

### Picking just one format

```bash
# Outline only, no dendrogram
litmap cluster --collection "My Papers" --format md --output ~/Desktop/outline

# Interactive dendrogram only
litmap cluster --collection "My Papers" --format html --output ~/Desktop/dendro
```

---

## 8. Exporting a Bibliography from a Manuscript

`scripts/manuscript_to_bib.py` extracts Zotero citations from a manuscript and exports a `.bib` file you can import into Zotero — useful for creating a collection from a paper's reference list.

```bash
uv run scripts/manuscript_to_bib.py my_paper.docx refs.bib
```

Works with two document types:

- **Word documents with live Zotero field codes** — keys extracted directly from the field code JSON.
- **Google Docs exports (.docx)** — field codes are stripped on export, so the script falls back to DOI extraction from the bibliography. Requires a Zotero bibliography that includes DOI numbers (e.g. Methods in Ecology & Evolution style).

The script tries field codes first and falls back to DOI extraction automatically. To import the result: Zotero → File → Import → select the `.bib` file.

---

## 9. Only Generating One Output Format

By default `--format all` writes HTML + PNG + PDF. To save time:

```bash
# Interactive HTML only (fastest)
litmap map --collection "My Papers" --format html --output ~/Desktop/map

# Static files only
litmap map --collection "My Papers" --format png --output ~/Desktop/map
```

---

## 10. Using litmap with the manuscript-audit Skill

If you use the `manuscript-audit` skill in Claude, it automatically calls `litmap search` during citation gap detection to find semantically relevant papers for unsupported claims.

To check it's wired up correctly:

```bash
litmap search \
  --query "biodiversity loss accelerating globally" \
  --format json
```

If this returns valid JSON, the skill will use it.

---

## 11. Keeping the Embedding Cache Up to Date

The cache updates automatically at the start of every command. When you add papers to Zotero, the next `litmap` invocation will embed them:

```
Syncing new papers: 100%|████| 12/12 [00:03<00:00,  3.8 paper/s]
```

If Zotero is already up to date, nothing is printed and the command proceeds immediately.

To force a manual sync:

```bash
litmap sync
litmap sync --force   # regenerate all embeddings
```

---

## Tips

- **Large libraries (1000+ papers):** `litmap map` can take 30–60 seconds for the UMAP step. Use `--format html` to skip the matplotlib render if you only need the interactive version.
- **BibTeX input:** `litmap map --manuscript refs.bib` and `litmap cluster --manuscript refs.bib` both work with `.bib` files — useful if you're writing in LaTeX.
- **The embedding model is local:** after first download, all commands work offline. No API keys, no rate limits.
- **Zotero does not need to be running:** litmap reads `~/Zotero/zotero.sqlite` directly in read-only mode.
- **Missing PDFs:** if `litmap info` shows `PDF: —` for a paper you expect to have a PDF, right-click the item in Zotero and choose Find Available PDF, then re-run `litmap sync-fulltext`.
